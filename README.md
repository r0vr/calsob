CalSob is a small program written in python to help it's creator both learn programming and stay on the wagon. There is no option to remove a substance. If the user fails to stay off of the substance after entering it, they need to go into SQL themselves and remove it to start over, or remove the whole database and enter it all in again. The creator really doesn't want to do that.
